#About st patches and configuration files

The top-level file config.h is the exact config I'm currently using.
If you want to build my exact st then go up one level
and go to st-gruvbox-dark-powerline.
This is a pkgbuild for my current configuration.

The colors folder contains diffs for various config.h files.
The patches only change the color scheme and nothing else.
They were created against the latest st git revision, not the release version.
